# Li-Fi : Data Transmission using light 
## Overview

This project focuses on establishing communication between an Arduino and an Atmega32 microcontroller using Light Fidelity (LiFi) technology.  
LiFi utilizes light to transmit data, in contrast to traditional methods like WiFi that use radio waves. In this setup, a custom communication protocol has been developed where data is transmitted by blinking a LED at specific intervals, and LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) receives the light signals and decodes them.
